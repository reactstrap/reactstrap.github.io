Most commonly\n\t * it's used to animate the mounting and unmounting of a component, but can also\n\t * be used to describe in-place transition states as well.\n\t *\n\t * By default the `Transition` component does not alter the behavior of the\n\t * component it renders, it only tracks \"enter\" and \"exit\" states for the components.\n\t * It's up to you to give meaning and effect to those states. For example we can\n\t * add styles to a component when it enters or exits:\n\t *\n\t * ```jsx\n\t * import Transition from 'react-transition-group/Transition';\n\t *\n\t * const duration = 300;\n\t *\n\t * const defaultStyle = {\n\t *   transition: `opacity ${duration}ms ease-in-out`,\n\t *   opacity: 0,\n\t * }\n\t *\n\t * const transitionStyles = {\n\t *   entering: { opacity: 0 },\n\t *   entered:  { opacity: 1 },\n\t * };\n\t *\n\t * const Fade = ({ in: inProp }) => (\n\t *   <Transition in={inProp} timeout={duration}>\n\t *     {(state) => (\n\t *       <div style={{\n\t *         ...defaultStyle,\n\t *         ...transitionStyles[state]\n\t *       }}>\n\t *         I'm a fade Transition!\n\t *       </div>\n\t *     )}\n\t *   </Transition>\n\t * );\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * As noted the `Transition` component doesn't _do_ anything by itself to its child component.\n\t * What it does do is track transition states over time so you can update the\n\t * component (such as by adding styles or classes) when it changes states.\n\t *\n\t * There are 4 main states a Transition can be in:\n\t *  - `'entering'`\n\t *  - `'entered'`\n\t *  - `'exiting'`\n\t *  - `'exited'`\n\t *\n\t * Transition state is toggled via the `in` prop. When `true` the component begins the\n\t * \"Enter\" stage. During this stage, the component will shift from its current transition state,\n\t * to `'entering'` for the duration of the transition and then to the `'entered'` stage once\n\t * it's complete. Let's take the following example:\n\t *\n\t * ```jsx\n\t * state = { in: false };\n\t *\n\t * toggleEnterState = () => {\n\t *   this.setState({ in: true });\n\t * }\n\t *\n\t * render() {\n\t *   return (\n\t *     <div>\n\t *       <Transition in={this.state.in} timeout={500} />\n\t *       <button onClick={this.toggleEnterState}>Click to Enter</button>\n\t *     </div>\n\t *   );\n\t * }\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * When the button is clicked the component will shift to the `'entering'` state and\n\t * stay there for 500ms (the value of `timeout`) before it finally switches to `'entered'`.\n\t *\n\t * When `in` is `false` the same thing happens except the state moves from `'exiting'` to `'exited'`.\n\t *\n\t * ## Timing\n\t *\n\t * Timing is often the trickiest part of animation, mistakes can result in slight delays\n\t * that are hard to pin down. A common example is when you want to add an exit transition,\n\t * you should set the desired final styles when the state is `'exiting'`. That's when the\n\t * transition to those styles will start and, if you matched the `timeout` prop with the\n\t * CSS Transition duration, it will end exactly when the state changes to `'exited'`.\n\t *\n\t * > **Note**: For simpler transitions the `Transition` component might be enough, but\n\t * > take into account that it's platform-agnostic, while the `CSSTransition` component\n\t * > [forces reflows](https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group/blob/5007303e729a74be66a21c3e2205e4916821524b/src/CSSTransition.js#L208-L215)\n\t * > in order to make more complex transitions more predictable.

Most commonly\n * it's used to animate the mounting and unmounting of a component, but can also\n * be used to describe in-place transition states as well.\n *\n * By default the `Transition` component does not alter the behavior of the\n * component it renders, it only tracks \"enter\" and \"exit\" states for the components.\n * It's up to you to give meaning and effect to those states. For example we can\n * add styles to a component when it enters or exits:\n *\n * ```jsx\n * import Transition from 'react-transition-group/Transition';\n *\n * const duration = 300;\n *\n * const defaultStyle = {\n *   transition: `opacity ${duration}ms ease-in-out`,\n *   opacity: 0,\n * }\n *\n * const transitionStyles = {\n *   entering: { opacity: 0 },\n *   entered:  { opacity: 1 },\n * };\n *\n * const Fade = ({ in: inProp }) => (\n *   <Transition in={inProp} timeout={duration}>\n *     {(state) => (\n *       <div style={{\n *         ...defaultStyle,\n *         ...transitionStyles[state]\n *       }}>\n *         I'm a fade Transition!\n *       </div>\n *     )}\n *   </Transition>\n * );\n * ```\n *\n * As noted the `Transition` component doesn't _do_ anything by itself to its child component.\n * What it does do is track transition states over time so you can update the\n * component (such as by adding styles or classes) when it changes states.\n *\n * There are 4 main states a Transition can be in:\n *  - `'entering'`\n *  - `'entered'`\n *  - `'exiting'`\n *  - `'exited'`\n *\n * Transition state is toggled via the `in` prop. When `true` the component begins the\n * \"Enter\" stage. During this stage, the component will shift from its current transition state,\n * to `'entering'` for the duration of the transition and then to the `'entered'` stage once\n * it's complete. Let's take the following example:\n *\n * ```jsx\n * state = { in: false };\n *\n * toggleEnterState = () => {\n *   this.setState({ in: true });\n * }\n *\n * render() {\n *   return (\n *     <div>\n *       <Transition in={this.state.in} timeout={500} />\n *       <button onClick={this.toggleEnterState}>Click to Enter</button>\n *     </div>\n *   );\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * When the button is clicked the component will shift to the `'entering'` state and\n * stay there for 500ms (the value of `timeout`) before it finally switches to `'entered'`.\n *\n * When `in` is `false` the same thing happens except the state moves from `'exiting'` to `'exited'`.\n *\n * ## Timing\n *\n * Timing is often the trickiest part of animation, mistakes can result in slight delays\n * that are hard to pin down. A common example is when you want to add an exit transition,\n * you should set the desired final styles when the state is `'exiting'`.

It is triggered when only a single string\n          is the child. A Button will be created and all of the props will be passed to it with the exception of\n          <code>groupClassName</code> and <code>groupAttributes</code>, which are used to added classes and attributes\n          to the wrapping container. This means you can add your <code>onClick</code> and other handlers directly to\n          <code>InputGroupButton</code>. If you want your string to not be wrapped in a button, then you really want to\n          use <code>InputGroupAddon</code> (see Addons above for that).\n        </p>\n        <div

The library does not depend on jQuery or Bootstrap javascript. However, <a href=\"https://popper.js.org/\">https://popper.js.org/</a> via <a href=\"https://github.com/souporserious/react-popper\">https://github.com/souporserious/react-popper</a> is relied upon for advanced positioning of content like Tooltips, Popovers, and auto-flipping Dropdowns.</p>\n            <p>There are a few core concepts to understand in order to make the most out of this library.</p>\n            <p>1) Your content is expected to be composed via props.children rather than using named props to pass in Components.</p>\n            <pre>\n              <PrismCode className=\"language-jsx\">\n{`// Content passed in via props\nconst Example = (props) => {\n  return (\n    <p>This is a tooltip <TooltipTrigger tooltip={TooltipContent}>example</TooltipTrigger>!</p>\n  );\n}\n\n// Content passed in as children (Preferred)\nconst PreferredExample = (props) => {\n  return (\n    <p>\n      This is a <a href=\"#\" id=\"TooltipExample\">tooltip</a> example.\n      <Tooltip target=\"TooltipExample\">\n        <TooltipContent/>\n      </Tooltip>\n    </p>\n  );\n}`}\n              </PrismCode>\n            </pre>\n            <p>\n              2) Attributes in this library are used to pass in state, conveniently apply modifier classes, enable advanced functionality (like popperjs), or automatically include non-content based elements.\n            </p>\n            <p>Examples:</p>\n            <ul>\n              <li><code>isOpen</code> - current state for items like dropdown, popover, tooltip</li>\n              <li><code>toggle</code> - callback for toggling isOpen in the controlling component</li>\n              <li><code>color</code> - applies color classes, ex: <code>{'<Button color=\"danger\"/>'}</code></li>\n              <li><code>size</code> for controlling size classes. ex: <code>{'<Button size=\"sm\"/>'}</code></li>\n              <li><code>tag</code> - customize component output by passing in an element name or Component</li>\n              <li>boolean based props (attributes) when possible for alternative style classes or sr-only content</li>\n            </ul>\n          </Col>\n        </Row>\n      </Container>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./docs/lib/Home/index.js","import React from 'react';\nimport { Button, Container, Row, Col } from 'reactstrap';\nimport { Link } from 'react-router';\nimport Helmet from 'react-helmet';\n\nexport default () => {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <Helmet title=\"404 Page Not Found\" />\n      <section className=\"jumbotron text-center mb-3\">\n        <Container>\n          <Row>\n            <Col>\n              <p className=\"lead\">\n                <img src=\"/assets/logo.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150px\" />\n              </p>\n              <h1 className=\"jumbotron-heading display-4\">404 - Not Found</h1>\n              <p className=\"lead\">\n                Can't find what you're looking for?
