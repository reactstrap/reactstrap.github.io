Most commonly\n * it's used to animate the mounting and unmounting of a component, but can also\n * be used to describe in-place transition states as well.\n *\n * ---\n *\n * **Note**: `Transition` is a platform-agnostic base component. If you're using\n * transitions in CSS, you'll probably want to use\n * [`CSSTransition`](https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/css-transition)\n * instead. It inherits all the features of `Transition`, but contains\n * additional features necessary to play nice with CSS transitions (hence the\n * name of the component).\n *\n * ---\n *\n * By default the `Transition` component does not alter the behavior of the\n * component it renders, it only tracks \"enter\" and \"exit\" states for the\n * components. It's up to you to give meaning and effect to those states. For\n * example we can add styles to a component when it enters or exits:\n *\n * ```jsx\n * import { Transition } from 'react-transition-group';\n *\n * const duration = 300;\n *\n * const defaultStyle = {\n *   transition: `opacity ${duration}ms ease-in-out`,\n *   opacity: 0,\n * }\n *\n * const transitionStyles = {\n *   entering: { opacity: 0 },\n *   entered:  { opacity: 1 },\n * };\n *\n * const Fade = ({ in: inProp }) => (\n *   <Transition in={inProp} timeout={duration}>\n *     {state => (\n *       <div style={{\n *         ...defaultStyle,\n *         ...transitionStyles[state]\n *       }}>\n *         I'm a fade Transition!\n *       </div>\n *     )}\n *   </Transition>\n * );\n * ```\n *\n * There are 4 main states a Transition can be in:\n *  - `'entering'`\n *  - `'entered'`\n *  - `'exiting'`\n *  - `'exited'`\n *\n * Transition state is toggled via the `in` prop. When `true` the component\n * begins the \"Enter\" stage. During this stage, the component will shift from\n * its current transition state, to `'entering'` for the duration of the\n * transition and then to the `'entered'` stage once it's complete. Let's take\n * the following example (we'll use the\n * [useState](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usestate) hook):\n *\n * ```jsx\n * function App() {\n *   const [inProp, setInProp] = useState(false);\n *   return (\n *     <div>\n *       <Transition in={inProp} timeout={500}>\n *         {state => (\n *           // ...\n *         )}\n *       </Transition>\n *       <button onClick={() => setInProp(true)}>\n *         Click to Enter\n *       </button>\n *     </div>\n *   );\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * When the button is clicked the component will shift to the `'entering'` state\n * and stay there for 500ms (the value of `timeout`) before it finally switches\n * to `'entered'`.\n *\n * When `in` is `false` the same thing happens except the state moves from\n * `'exiting'` to `'exited'`.\n */\n\nexports.EXITING = EXITING;\n\nvar Transition =\n/*#__PURE__*/\nfunction (_React$Component) {\n  _inheritsLoose(Transition, _React$Component);\n\n  function Transition(props, context) {\n    var _this;\n\n    _this = _React$Component.call(this, props, context) || this;\n    var parentGroup = context.transitionGroup; // In the context of a TransitionGroup all enters are really appears\n\n    var appear = parentGroup && !parentGroup.isMounting ?

However, <a href=\"https://popper.js.org/\">https://popper.js.org/</a> via <a href=\"https://github.com/souporserious/react-popper\">https://github.com/souporserious/react-popper</a> is relied upon for advanced positioning of content like Tooltips, Popovers, and auto-flipping Dropdowns.</p>\n            <p>There are a few core concepts to understand in order to make the most out of this library.</p>\n            <p>1) Your content is expected to be composed via props.children rather than using named props to pass in Components.</p>\n            <pre>\n              <PrismCode className=\"language-jsx\">\n{`// Content passed in via props\nconst Example = (props) => {\n  return (\n    <p>This is a tooltip <TooltipTrigger tooltip={TooltipContent}>example</TooltipTrigger>!</p>\n  );\n}\n\n// Content passed in as children (Preferred)\nconst PreferredExample = (props) => {\n  return (\n    <p>\n      This is a <a href=\"#\" id=\"TooltipExample\">tooltip</a> example.\n      <Tooltip target=\"TooltipExample\">\n        <TooltipContent/>\n      </Tooltip>\n    </p>\n  );\n}`}\n              </PrismCode>\n            </pre>\n            <p>\n              2) Attributes in this library are used to pass in state, conveniently apply modifier classes, enable advanced functionality (like popperjs), or automatically include non-content based elements.\n            </p>\n            <p>Examples:</p>\n            <ul>\n              <li><code>isOpen</code> - current state for items like dropdown, popover, tooltip</li>\n              <li><code>toggle</code> - callback for toggling isOpen in the controlling component</li>\n              <li><code>color</code> - applies color classes, ex: <code>{'<Button color=\"danger\"/>'}</code></li>\n              <li><code>size</code> for controlling size classes. ex: <code>{'<Button size=\"sm\"/>'}</code></li>\n              <li><code>tag</code> - customize component output by passing in an element name or Component</li>\n              <li>boolean based props (attributes) when possible for alternative style classes or sr-only content</li>\n            </ul>\n          </Col>\n        </Row>\n      </Container>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n","\"use strict\"\n\nObject.defineProperty(exports, \"__esModule\", {\n  value: true,\n})\n\nvar _createClass = (function() {\n  function defineProperties(target, props) {\n    for (var i = 0; i < props.length; i++) {\n      var descriptor = props[i]\n      descriptor.enumerable = descriptor.enumerable || false\n      descriptor.configurable = true\n      if (\"value\" in descriptor) descriptor.writable = true\n      Object.defineProperty(target, descriptor.key, descriptor)\n    }\n  }\n  return function(Constructor, protoProps, staticProps) {\n    if (protoProps) defineProperties(Constructor.prototype, protoProps)\n    if (staticProps) defineProperties(Constructor, staticProps)\n    return Constructor\n  }\n})()\n\nvar _react = require(\"react\")\n\nvar _react2 = _interopRequireDefault(_react)\n\nvar _propTypes = require(\"prop-types\")\n\nfunction _interopRequireDefault(obj) {\n  return obj && obj.__esModule ? obj : { default: obj }\n}\n\nfunction _classCallCheck(instance, Constructor) {\n  if (!(instance instanceof Constructor)) {\n    throw new TypeError(\"Cannot call a class as a function\")\n  }\n}\n\nfunction _possibleConstructorReturn(self, call) {\n  if (!self) {\n    throw new ReferenceError(\n      \"this hasn't been initialised - super() hasn't been called\"\n    )\n  }\n  return call && (typeof call === \"object\" || typeof call === \"function\")\n    ? call\n    : self\n}\n\nfunction _inherits(subClass, superClass) {\n  if (typeof superClass !== \"function\" && superClass !== null) {\n    throw new TypeError(\n      \"Super expression must either be null or a function, not \" +\n        typeof superClass\n    )\n  }\n  subClass.prototype = Object.create(superClass && superClass.prototype, {\n    constructor: {\n      value: subClass,\n      enumerable: false,\n      writable: true,\n      configurable: true,\n    },\n  })\n  if (superClass)\n    Object.setPrototypeOf\n      ?

It's built upon the\n * [`Transition`](https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/transition)\n * component, so it inherits all of its props.\n *\n * `CSSTransition` applies a pair of class names during the `appear`, `enter`,\n * and `exit` states of the transition. The first class is applied and then a\n * second `*-active` class in order to activate the CSSS transition. After the\n * transition, matching `*-done` class names are applied to persist the\n * transition state.\n *\n * ```jsx\n * function App() {\n *   const [inProp, setInProp] = useState(false);\n *   return (\n *     <div>\n *       <CSSTransition in={inProp} timeout={200} classNames=\"my-node\">\n *         <div>\n *           {\"I'll receive my-node-* classes\"}\n *         </div>\n *       </CSSTransition>\n *       <button type=\"button\" onClick={() => setInProp(true)}>\n *         Click to Enter\n *       </button>\n *     </div>\n *   );\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * When the `in` prop is set to `true`, the child component will first receive\n * the class `example-enter`, then the `example-enter-active` will be added in\n * the next tick. `CSSTransition` [forces a\n * reflow](https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group/blob/5007303e729a74be66a21c3e2205e4916821524b/src/CSSTransition.js#L208-L215)\n * between before adding the `example-enter-active`. This is an important trick\n * because it allows us to transition between `example-enter` and\n * `example-enter-active` even though they were added immediately one after\n * another. Most notably, this is what makes it possible for us to animate\n * _appearance_.\n *\n * ```css\n * .my-node-enter {\n *   opacity: 0;\n * }\n * .my-node-enter-active {\n *   opacity: 1;\n *   transition: opacity 200ms;\n * }\n * .my-node-exit {\n *   opacity: 1;\n * }\n * .my-node-exit-active {\n *   opacity: 0;\n *   transition: opacity: 200ms;\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * `*-active` classes represent which styles you want to animate **to**.\n */\n\n\nvar CSSTransition =\n/*#__PURE__*/\nfunction (_React$Component) {\n  _inheritsLoose(CSSTransition, _React$Component);\n\n  function CSSTransition() {\n    var _this;\n\n    for (var _len = arguments.length, args = new Array(_len), _key = 0; _key < _len; _key++) {\n      args[_key] = arguments[_key];\n    }\n\n    _this = _React$Component.call.apply(_React$Component, [this].concat(args)) || this;\n\n    _this.onEnter = function (node, appearing) {\n      var _this$getClassNames = _this.getClassNames(appearing ?

It is triggered when only a single string\n          is the child. A Button will be created and all of the props will be passed to it with the exception of\n          <code>groupClassName</code> and <code>groupAttributes</code>, which are used to added classes and attributes\n          to the wrapping container. This means you can add your <code>onClick</code> and other handlers directly to\n          <code>InputGroupButton</code>. If you want your string to not be wrapped in a button, then you really want to\n          use <code>InputGroupAddon</code> (see Addons above for that).\n        </p>\n        <div
