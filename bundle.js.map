Most commonly\n * it's used to animate the mounting and unmounting of a component, but can also\n * be used to describe in-place transition states as well.\n *\n * By default the `Transition` component does not alter the behavior of the\n * component it renders, it only tracks \"enter\" and \"exit\" states for the components.\n * It's up to you to give meaning and effect to those states. For example we can\n * add styles to a component when it enters or exits:\n *\n * ```jsx\n * import Transition from 'react-transition-group/Transition';\n *\n * const duration = 300;\n *\n * const defaultStyle = {\n *   transition: `opacity ${duration}ms ease-in-out`,\n *   opacity: 0,\n * }\n *\n * const transitionStyles = {\n *   entering: { opacity: 0 },\n *   entered:  { opacity: 1 },\n * };\n *\n * const Fade = ({ in: inProp }) => (\n *   <Transition in={inProp} timeout={duration}>\n *     {(state) => (\n *       <div style={{\n *         ...defaultStyle,\n *         ...transitionStyles[state]\n *       }}>\n *         I'm a fade Transition!\n *       </div>\n *     )}\n *   </Transition>\n * );\n * ```\n *\n * As noted the `Transition` component doesn't _do_ anything by itself to its child component.\n * What it does do is track transition states over time so you can update the\n * component (such as by adding styles or classes) when it changes states.\n *\n * There are 4 main states a Transition can be in:\n *  - `'entering'`\n *  - `'entered'`\n *  - `'exiting'`\n *  - `'exited'`\n *\n * Transition state is toggled via the `in` prop. When `true` the component begins the\n * \"Enter\" stage. During this stage, the component will shift from its current transition state,\n * to `'entering'` for the duration of the transition and then to the `'entered'` stage once\n * it's complete. Let's take the following example:\n *\n * ```jsx\n * state = { in: false };\n *\n * toggleEnterState = () => {\n *   this.setState({ in: true });\n * }\n *\n * render() {\n *   return (\n *     <div>\n *       <Transition in={this.state.in} timeout={500} />\n *       <button onClick={this.toggleEnterState}>Click to Enter</button>\n *     </div>\n *   );\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * When the button is clicked the component will shift to the `'entering'` state and\n * stay there for 500ms (the value of `timeout`) before it finally switches to `'entered'`.\n *\n * When `in` is `false` the same thing happens except the state moves from `'exiting'` to `'exited'`.\n *\n * ## Timing\n *\n * Timing is often the trickiest part of animation, mistakes can result in slight delays\n * that are hard to pin down. A common example is when you want to add an exit transition,\n * you should set the desired final styles when the state is `'exiting'`. That's when the\n * transition to those styles will start and, if you matched the `timeout` prop with the\n * CSS Transition duration, it will end exactly when the state changes to `'exited'`.\n *\n * > **Note**: For simpler transitions the `Transition` component might be enough, but\n * > take into account that it's platform-agnostic, while the `CSSTransition` component\n * > [forces reflows](https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group/blob/5007303e729a74be66a21c3e2205e4916821524b/src/CSSTransition.js#L208-L215)\n * > in order to make more complex transitions more predictable. For example, even though\n * > classes `example-enter` and `example-enter-active` are applied immediately one after\n * > another, you can still transition from one to the other because of the forced reflow\n * > (read [this issue](https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group/issues/159#issuecomment-322761171)\n * > for more info).

(Stateful Buttons)</SectionTitle>\n        <p>\n          In order to have checkbox and radio buttons, your component needs to manage the state of which button(s) are active/select. It is not in the opinion of this library to manage state within it's components so it is left up to you. Below is a simple example showcasing how this could be done using the components which already exist in this library.\n        </p>\n        <div className=\"docs-example\">\n          <ButtonStateful />\n        </div>\n        <pre>\n          <PrismCode className=\"language-jsx\">\n            {ButtonStatefulSource}\n          </PrismCode>\n        </pre>\n\n        <SectionTitle>Close icon</SectionTitle>\n        <p>\n          Use a generic close icon to dismiss content. Use <code>&lt;Button close /&gt;</code> for the default icon. Otherwise, custom content for the button\n          may be defined. (e.g. JSX: <code>&lt;Button close&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden=\"true\"&gt;&ndash;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/Button&gt;</code>) The default aria-label is \"Close\".\n        </p>\n        <div

<code>Dropdown</code> component is used to pass the <code>isOpen</code> &amp; <code>toggle</code> props via context to the following components: <code>DropdownToggle</code>, <code>DropdownMenu</code>. The <code>DropdownToggle</code> uses the <code>Button</code> component internally, meaning it also accepts all the props the <Link to=\"/components/buttons/\">Button component</Link> accepts.\n        </p>\n        <div className=\"docs-example\">\n          <DropdownExample />\n        </div>\n        <pre>\n          <PrismCode className=\"language-jsx\">\n            {DropdownExampleSource}\n          </PrismCode>\n        </pre>\n        <h4>Properties</h4>\n        <pre>\n          <PrismCode className=\"language-jsx\">\n{`Dropdown.propTypes = {\n  disabled: PropTypes.bool,\n  direction: PropTypes.oneOf(['up', 'down', 'left', 'right']),\n  group: PropTypes.bool,\n  isOpen: PropTypes.bool,\n  // For Dropdown usage inside a Nav\n  nav: PropTypes.bool,\n  active: PropTypes.bool,\n  // For Dropdown usage inside a Navbar (disables popper)\n  inNavbar: PropTypes.bool,\n  tag: PropTypes.string, // default: 'div' unless nav=true, then 'li'\n  toggle: PropTypes.func,\n  setActiveFromChild: PropTypes.bool\n};\n\nDropdownToggle.propTypes = {\n  caret: PropTypes.bool,\n  color: PropTypes.string,\n  className: PropTypes.string,\n  disabled: PropTypes.bool,\n  onClick: PropTypes.func,\n  'data-toggle': PropTypes.string,\n  'aria-haspopup': PropTypes.bool,\n  // For DropdownToggle usage inside a Nav\n  nav: PropTypes.bool,\n  // Defaults to Button component\n  tag: PropTypes.any\n};\n\nDropdownMenu.propTypes = {\n  tag: PropTypes.string,\n  children: PropTypes.node.isRequired,\n  right: PropTypes.bool,\n  flip: PropTypes.bool, // default: true,\n  className: PropTypes.string,\n  cssModule: PropTypes.object,\n  // Custom modifiers that are passed to DropdownMenu.js, see https://popper.js.org/popper-documentation.html#modifiers\n  modifiers: PropTypes.object,\n  persist: PropTypes.bool // presist the popper, even when closed.

It is triggered when only a single string\n          is the child. A Button will be created and all of the props will be passed to it with the exception of\n          <code>groupClassName</code> and <code>groupAttributes</code>, which are used to added classes and attributes\n          to the wrapping container. This means you can add your <code>onClick</code> and other handlers directly to\n          <code>InputGroupButton</code>. If you want your string to not be wrapped in a button, then you really want to\n          use <code>InputGroupAddon</code> (see Addons above for that).\n        </p>\n        <div
